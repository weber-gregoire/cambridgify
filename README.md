# Cambridgify

This is a simple npm pacakge that I created in order to demonstrate that some of the thing we see on the internet, and mosty on social networks might be attractive, but are usually not true.

This one bit of code is used to show that the "study from Cambridge" (that actually do not exists) saying that the human brain do not care about the order of letters in a word as long as the first and last letters are correctly placed is wrong.
The text used to d√©monstrate that is actually well crafted to make it easy to read. It also use relatively short word to make the scrambling ineficient.

But if you use that code to try, and use long word, you'll be able to experience by yourself that this do not really work.

## How to use

Will be added very soon :)
